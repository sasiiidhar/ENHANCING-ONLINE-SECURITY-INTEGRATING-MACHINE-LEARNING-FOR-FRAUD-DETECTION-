# ENHANCING-ONLINE-SECURITY-INTEGRATING-MACHINE-LEARNING-FOR-FRAUD-DETECTION

The rapid participation in online based transactional activities raises the fraudulent cases all over the world and causes tremendous losses to the individuals and financial industry. Card fraud events take place frequently and then result in huge financial losses. This project proposes a Enhancing Online Security: Integrating Machine Learning for Fraud Detection by the data preparation carried out to manipulate the raw data into a form that can readily and accurately be analysed.
The accuracy and quality of source data before training a new model version is checked by data validation. Further, to correlate the data train and to get the model's accuracy Cat boost Classifier and CNN classifier is used. However, the performance of the cat boost classifier are better only when the data are properly tuned. Moreover, the CNN classifiers require lot of training data for the effective functioning. Also, they fail to encode the position and orientation of the objects. To overcome the above limitations, the model's accuracy XG boost Classifier and LSTM classifier is used in phase II. The XG boost classifier uses a direct route to minimum error, converging more quickly with fewer steps. The LSTM are much better at handling long-term dependencies. For analysing the performance of the proposed work, it is implemented in python platform. The accuracy is validated are presented in both techniques.
